Description: Despite the recent advances of modern GWAS methods, it
        still remains an important problem of addressing calculation an
        effect size and corresponding p-value for the whole gene rather
        than for single variant. The R- package rqt offers gene-level
        GWAS meta-analysis. For more information, see: "Gene-set
        association tests for next-generation sequencing data" by Lee
        et al (2016), Bioinformatics, 32(17), i611-i619,
